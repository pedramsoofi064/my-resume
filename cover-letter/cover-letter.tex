\section*{Cover Letter – Fullstack Engineer, Health Intelligence}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fullstack Engineer role within the Oura Health Intelligence team. With over six years of experience, I specialize in building highly scalable, maintainable systems for enterprise platforms that support over **4M+ users**.

My background directly matches the need for a fullstack contributor focused on acceleration and quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Results-Driven Architecture:** I led architectural redesigns that cut development time by **10x** and streamlined component integration by **20x**.
    \item **Core Competencies:** My expertise is strong in **Front-End Architecture** (TypeScript + modern frameworks) and operating serverless **AWS** environments (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB).
    \item **Fullstack Commitment:** I am adept at designing robust APIs and committed to quickly leveraging my architectural knowledge to become proficient in Python for backend development.
\end{itemize}

I am eager to contribute my full-stack perspective and collaborative style to the Health Intelligence team's goal of accelerating learning cycles and improving user outcomes.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to discussing how my experience can benefit Oura.
