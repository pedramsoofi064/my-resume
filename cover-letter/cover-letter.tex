\noindent\textbf{Dear Hiring Team,}

\noindent I’m excited to apply for the Senior Front-End Engineer role at Tiger Data. Over the past years, I’ve built cloud-native SaaS interfaces where precision, usability, and performance are non-negotiable. I work closely with product and design to deliver fast, intentional UI/UX—caring deeply about motion, accessibility, and the details that shape a great developer experience. With strong experience in React, TypeScript, testing (including Cypress), and data-driven UI, I’m energized by Tiger Data’s mission to empower developers with a world-class PostgreSQL platform.

\noindent I thrive in environments with ownership, high engineering standards, and a deep focus on customer impact. Across my teams I’ve led performance refactors, built scalable design systems, eliminated UI friction, and contributed to end-to-end features including API-layer work. I love creating clear, intuitive user flows that make complex systems feel simple, and I’d be excited to bring this mindset to Tiger Data as you shape the next generation of real-time, intelligent cloud infrastructure. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, \\
