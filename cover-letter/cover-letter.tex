\section*{Cover Letter – Senior Frontend Engineer, Groweo}

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Frontend Engineer position at Groweo. With over six years of experience building scalable SaaS products — including platforms serving **4M+ users** — I bring a strong product mindset, architectural expertise, and a consistent record of delivering high-impact frontend systems.

My background aligns closely with Groweo’s need for a senior engineer who can accelerate product development, shape UX quality, and collaborate deeply across teams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proven Frontend Architecture Impact:} Designed and led micro-frontend and modular architectures that improved delivery speed by \textbf{10×} and accelerated Design System integration by \textbf{20×}.
    \item \textbf{Modern Frontend Excellence:} Expertise in \textbf{React, TypeScript, Clean Architecture,} and scalable component design, consistently delivering fast, accessible, and maintainable user interfaces.
    \item \textbf{Strong Product & Collaboration Mindset:} Worked closely with product, design, and backend teams in Agile environments, ensuring user-centric outcomes and driving consistent engineering quality.
\end{itemize}

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Groweo’s mission of making growth effortless for small businesses, and I would welcome the chance to bring my technical leadership and product thinking to your team.
