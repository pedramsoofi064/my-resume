\section*{Cover Letter – Senior Full-Stack Developer, cofenster}

I’m excited to apply for the Senior Full-Stack Developer role at cofenster. With over six years of experience building scalable, user-focused platforms for more than \textbf{4M users}, I’m drawn to cofenster’s mission of making professional video creation accessible to everyone—especially with your new AI video agents.

I love roles where product thinking, creativity, and engineering meet. At my previous teams, I led features end-to-end, improved system reliability, and helped create smoother and more intuitive user experiences. I work confidently across TypeScript, React, Node.js, and modern backend tooling, always aiming for clean, maintainable, and accessible solutions.

Most importantly, I’m genuinely \textbf{passionate about learning}. I constantly explore GitHub projects, experiment with new ideas, and look for better ways to solve problems. Curiosity keeps me growing, and it’s a mindset I bring to every team I join.

I’m inspired by cofenster’s vision and would be excited to contribute to building a platform that empowers people to tell better stories through video. Thank you for considering my application.
