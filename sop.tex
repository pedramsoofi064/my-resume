\section*{Statement of Purpose}

I started programming at an early age, driven by a genuine curiosity about how things work behind the scenes. Over time, this interest grew into a deep passion for building thoughtful, well-structured software. I began exploring everything from classic programming languages to more modern tools and frameworks, gradually finding my focus in creating \textbf{clean}, \textbf{scalable}, and \textbf{maintainable systems}.


Along the way, I developed a strong interest in \textbf{software design and architecture}. Concepts like \textbf{clean code}, good structure, and maintainable systems became more than just practices --- they became \textbf{principles I truly care about}. I’ve spent a lot of time reading, experimenting, and learning about design approaches that make software easier to understand, improve, and scale.


To summarize myself into a minimum set of attributes I would say I'm a
continuous learner who hugely values technical quality. So, a job position with
lots of learning opportunities and a never-ceasing attention to technical
quality makes the ideal work that I could imagine. Due to this mindset, I think,
I'd be a better fit for companies/projects where their products are software
platforms/systems/tools that empower other businesses.

Currently, I work as a \textbf{full-stack developer}, primarily using \textbf{JavaScript}, \textbf{TypeScript}, and \textbf{Node.js} on the backend, along with modern frontend frameworks like \textbf{Vue} and \textbf{React}. 
In the coming months, I plan to \textbf{relocate to Finland} and look forward to bringing my experience and enthusiasm for thoughtful software development to a new environment.
